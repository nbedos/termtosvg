.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
termtosvg makes recordings of terminal sessions in animated SVG format.
If no output filename is provided, a random temporary filename will be
automatically generated.
.SS COMMANDS
.PP
The default behavior of termtosvg is to render an SVG animation
.SS termtosvg record
.PP
Record a terminal session in asciicast v2 format.
The recording is a text file which contains timing information as well
as what was displayed on the screen during the terminal session.
It may be edited to alter the timing of the recording or the information
displayed on the screen of the terminal.
.SS termtosvg render
.PP
Render an animated SVG from a recording in asciicast v1 or v2 format.
This allows rendering in SVG format of any recording made with
asciinema.
.SS OPTIONS
.SS \-g, \[en]screen\-geometry=GEOMETRY
.PP
geometry of the terminal screen used for rendering the animation.
The geometry must be given as the number of columns and the number of
rows on the screen separated by the character \[lq]x\[rq].
For example \[lq]82x19\[rq] for an 82 columns by 19 rows screen.
.SS \-h, \[en]help
.PP
Print usage and exit
.SS \-m, \[en]min\-frame\-duration=MIN_DURATION
.PP
Set the minimum duration of a frame in milliseconds.
Frames lasting less than MIN_DURATION milliseconds will be merged with
consecutive frames.
The default behavior of termtosvg is to produce a frame for each update
of the terminal screen, but when recording commands that update the
screen very frequently this can cause animations filesize to blow up.
Enforcing a minimum frame duration helps reduces the number of frame of
the animations, and thus helps control the size of animation.
MIN_DURATION defaults to 1 millisecond.
.SS \-M, \[en]max\-frame\-duration=MAX_DURATION
.PP
Set the maximum duration of a frame to MAX_DURATION milliseconds.
Frames lasting longer than MAX_DURATION milliseconds will simply see
their duration reduced to MAX_DURATION.
.SS \-t, \[en]template=TEMPLATE
.PP
Set the SVG template used for rendering the SVG animation.
TEMPLATE may either be one of the default templates (gjm8, dracula,
solarized_dark, solarized_light, progress_bar, window_frame,
window_frame_js) or a path to a valid template.
.SS SVG TEMPLATES
.PP
Templates make it possible to customize the SVG animation produced by
termtosvg in a number of ways including, but not limited to:
.IP \[bu] 2
Specifying the color theme and font used for rendering the terminal
session
.IP \[bu] 2
Adding a custom terminal window frame to the animation to make it look
like a real terminal
.IP \[bu] 2
Adding JavaScript code to pause the animation, seek to a specific frame,
etc
.PP
See the dedicated manual page (termtosvg-templates.md) for more details.
.SS ENVIRONMENT
.PP
termtosvg will spawn the shell specified by the SHELL environment
variable, or \f[C]/bin/sh\f[] if the variable does not exist.
Spawning a new shell is necessary so that termtosvg can act as an
intermediary between the shell and the pseudo terminal and capture all
the data sent to the terminal.
.SS EXAMPLES
